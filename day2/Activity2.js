// Assignment Operators

// Task 6 : use the += operator to add a nbumber to a variablke and log the result

let a = 25;
a += 10;
console.log(a);


// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

a -= 10;
console.log(a);

//a+=10 means a=a+10
//similarly all opoerators act like this 
//e.g a-=10 means a = a - 10
